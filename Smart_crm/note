hi
hi

the first issue let me show you
what is second point ?
what the solution of the first?
i'm not getting
ok it is a one 2many relation ok?
ok
all record of the object car should be showed in the tree of proposal?
ok
in list view we can not display record of one2many or many2many it wull display only rorords if count
ok

i mean that each car has many hig
shat is car
i don;t know car
first let me know ever
 car is object model ok?
 make it compute field
 ok?
hi

for hide one2many column based on parent field i have find something if you want thehn i show you
ok javascript solution?
that javascipy already written on odoo 11 base code
one moment let me give you an example
attrs="{'column_invisible': [('parent.state', 'not in', ['sale', 'done'])], 'readonly': [('qty_delivered_updateable', '=', False)]}"

this is example that you can write in xml
ok i will try but now i have an urgent task
yes
in each object like car if i press the list record will show me the proposal of this record

main problem is i can't see your coursor
so not able to see to where you are demostating
so check for enabling pointer
so i can see your pointer
ok
on;y benifits name ?
no and value also
how ?
give me exmaple how look
like in record
insurer product premium nour vds savdv avsdv
nour and the following are benfits
it just a namewan
ok depend on field in tob model
means ?
exlain well
ok each product has many benfits
doinfef emorment
sho me on browser
ok let me decsripe my business?
ok
each product has many benfits ok?
ok
i want show the benfits of selected product in the list view ok?


my quedtion
is
you want to show name only
there is two column in grid
not the two column
ok
then?
i'm not getting you what you need
TOB is related to another model ok?
ok
then
YOU WANT TO SHOW WHOLE RECORD OF THAT FIELD ?
yes
not oissubke
just thingk
how you wdisplay recor in single cell
is this logical thing
i agreee not in same column
i want make columns depend on number of benfits
many columns you add ?
yes depend on number of benfits the
 how many ?
 number of benfits product have
 not possible
 ok what the best solution for you?

create compute function for showing like name of benifites

(0, 0,  { values }) link to a new record that needs to be created with the given values dictionary

(1, ID, { values }) update the linked record with id = ID (write values on it)

(2, ID) remove and delete the linked record with id = ID (calls unlink on ID, that will delete the object completely, and the link to it as well)

(3, ID) cut the link to the linked record with id = ID (delete the relationship between the two objects but does not delete the target object itself)

(4, ID) link to existing record with id = ID (adds a relationship)

(5) unlink all (like using (3,ID) for all linked records)

(6, 0, [IDs]) replace the list of linked IDs (like using (5) then (4,ID) for each ID in the list of IDs)
